# Accidental overdose deaths and economic indicators

This project will present a visualization of the relationship between county-to-county economic indicators in Connecticut and the per capita incidence of accidental overdose deaths between 2012 and 2018.

Conclusions can be found in [Project Report.ipynb](Project%Report.ipynb).

In summary: Many numbers were moved around, and no conclusions were drawn.

*NOTE:* This project is focused on Python programming, not public policy; I am not trained in statistical analysis aside from being able to code it, and no definitive conclusions should be drawn from this.

## Tools
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
